    "To scale the data in preparation for the neural network in image classification, standardization and normalization can be used. Pixel values are ranging between 0 and 255.\n",
    "The normalization rescales the values to a range between 0 and 1.\n",
    "The standardization assumes a gaussian distribution of the data values. The rescaling will set the mean as zero and most of the data points will fall within three standard deviations from it (range between about -3 and 3).\n",

    "For scaling images the ImageDataGenerator can be used. It comes from keras, which is a python library.\n",
    "The ImageDataGenerator can be called for various tasks, including scaling but also augmentation.\n",
